# Code of Conduct {#about_code_of_conduct}

BioC++ adheres to the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/). From the code of conduct:

> A primary goal of all the conferences and user groups that refer to this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).

> A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

# Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the
project or its community. In particular, it applies to:

  * Communication on GitHub, including issues, pull-requests and commit messages
  * the Gitter chat rooms
  * social media accounts of BioC++
  * BioC++ related meetings in real life

# Enforcement

BioC++ is currently still a small project. Contributors pledge to uphold the Code of Conduct, and regulations for enforcement and/or a dedicated contact person will be published in the future.
