The documentation here is relevant for all **users** of BioC++.

The source-code and issue-tracking is available on [Github](https://github.com/biocpp).
Information for developers of BioC++ and details on how to contribute
are in the [wiki](https://github.com/biocpp/biocpp/wiki/Contributing).

Before you publish and/or redistribute software based on BioC++, please check the individual library's copyright
