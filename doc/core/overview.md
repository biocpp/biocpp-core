# Core library overview {#core_overview}

This is the core library of the BioC++ project. Most other BioC++ libraries depend on it.
It provides the following modules:

* Alphabet: data structures that represent single biological compounds like DNA, RNA and amino acids.
* Ranges: containers, views and utilities for storing and manipulating sequences of biological compounds.
* Meta: metaprogramming utilities and auxilliary data structures.

The design of this module is heavily influenced by C++ Ranges and C++ Concepts. Tutorials with introductions into these topics and the modules are available on the left.

More advanced HowTos are also provided.
